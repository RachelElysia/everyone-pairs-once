# everyone-pairs-once

Randomly pairs people in rounds with no repetition until everyone has been paired together

## Inspiration:

My bootcamp experience was being re-paired with the samebpeople several times
and never had the opportunities to code with others.

## Relation to teaching: 

Students choose their friends,
Teachers choose heterogeneous or homogenous pairs.

## Potential solution:

This is random pairs with no repetition!

Given a list of names, names are returned each round as pairs.
Each pair is only shown once.

Pairs will be kept in a set as to not be repeated.
If individual is are already in a set during a round, the algorithm will reroll.
